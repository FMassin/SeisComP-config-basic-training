**Associates an Origin to an Event or forms a new Event if no match is found. Selects the preferred magnitude.**


Description
===========

As a consequence of a real-time system the SeisComP system creates several
origins (results of localization processes) for one earthquake because as time
goes by more seismic phases are available. scevent receives these origins and
associates the origins to events. It is also possible to import origins from
other agencies.


Origin Matching
---------------

scevent associates origins to events by searching for the best match of the new
(incoming) origin to other origins for existing events. If a match is not found
a new event can be formed. The new origin is matched to existing origins
by comparing differences in the horizontal components of the locations, origin
time difference, and matching picks.
The new origin is matched to an existing origin which has the highest rank in
the following three groups (1, 2, 3):

1. Location and Time (lowest)

   The difference in horizontal location is less than
   :confval:`eventAssociation.maximumDistance` (degrees)
   and the difference in origin times is less than
   :confval:`eventAssociation.maximumTimeSpan`.

2. Picks

   The two origins have more than :confval:`eventAssociation.minimumMatchingArrivals`
   matching picks. Picks are matched either by ID or by time depending
   on :confval:`eventAssociation.maximumMatchingArrivalTimeDiff`.

3. Picks and Location and Time (highest)

   This is the best match, for which both the location-and-time and picks
   criteria above are satisfied.

If more than one origin is found in the highest ranking class, then the first
one of them is chosen.

.. note::

   For efficiency events in the cache are scanned first and if no matches are found
   the database is scanned for the time window :confval:`eventAssociation.eventTimeBefore` - :confval:`eventAssociation.eventTimeAfter`
   around the incoming Origin time. The cached events are ordered by eventID and
   thus in time.

**No Origin Match**

If no event with an origin that matches the incoming origin is found then a
new event is formed and the origin is associated to that event. The following
criteria are applied to allow the creation of the new event:

The agency for the origin is not black listed (processing.blacklist.agencies).

and

If the origin is an automatic then it has more than eventAssociation.minimumDefiningPhases picks.

   Defines the pattern to generate an event ID.
   
   %p : prefix
   
   %Y : year
   
   %[w]c: alpha character
   
   %[w]C: upper case alpha character
   
   %[w]d: decimal
   
   %[w]x: hexadecimal
   
   %[w]X: upper case hexadecimal

.. confval:: processing.blacklist.eventIDs

   Type: *list:string*

   Defines a blacklist of event ids. The items of this list
   are only matches against %c, %C, %d, %x and %X of the
   eventIDPattern description. Year \(%Y\) and prefix \(%p\) are
   not matched. The match is case\-sensitive, so blacklisting
   e.g. abcd would only match in combination with %c. If %C
   is used ABCD has to be blacklisted.


.. confval:: eventAssociation.minimumMagnitudes

   Type: *int*

   Minimum number of station magnitudes referenced to a network magnitude
   to become a preferred magnitude.
   Default is ``4``.

.. confval:: eventAssociation.minimumMatchingArrivals

   Type: *int*

   Minimum number of matching picks between two origins to be associated
   to the same event.
   Default is ``3``.

.. confval:: eventAssociation.maximumMatchingArrivalTimeDiff

   Type: *double*

   Unit: *s*

   Negative time window: compare only pickIDs to find
   matching arrivals. A non negative
   value \(including 0\) compares pick times regardless
   of the pickID. Pass: \|pick1.time \- pick2.time\| <\= threshold
   Default is ``-1``.

.. confval:: eventAssociation.compareAllArrivalTimes

   Type: *boolean*

   This parameter is only used in conjunction with
   eventAssociation.maximumMatchingArrivalTimeDiff.
   If a station has multiple associated arrivals for a
   particular event, this flag defines if the time distance
   of a new pick to all arrivals must be within
   eventAssociation.maximumMatchingArrivalTimeDiff
   or if one matching arrival is enough.
   Default is ``true``.

.. confval:: eventAssociation.allowLooseAssociatedArrivals

.. confval:: eventAssociation.minimumScore

   Type: *double*

   Minimum score of an automatic origin to be allowed to
   form an new Event. This requires an activated score
   plugin and a score processor. Configure score for defining the
   score processor and the score processor parameters.
   If minimumScore is defined, minimumDefiningPhases has no effect at as
   this phase check will be superseded by the score check. It is
   the task of the score processor to evaluate a proper
   score for all input origins.

   time differs not more than 60 seconds unless the
   minimumMatchingArrivals criteria matches.
   Default is ``60``.

.. confval:: eventAssociation.maximumDistance

   Type: *double*

   Unit: *degrees*

   Allowed location difference between an incoming origin compared with
   preferred origins to get associated.
   Default is ``5``.

.. confval:: eventAssociation.minMwCount

   If true, one magnitude will be preferred even if magnitude criteria are
   not fullfilled.
   Default is ``false``.

.. confval:: eventAssociation.ignoreFMDerivedOrigins

   Type: *list:string*

   The agencyID priority list. When the eventtool comes to the point to
   select a preferred origin it orders all origins by its agency priority and
   selects then the best one among the highest priority agency. It also defines the
   agency priority for custom priority checks
   \(eventAssociation.priorities\).


.. confval:: eventAssociation.authors

   Type: *list:string*

   The author priority list. When the eventtool comes to the point to
   select a preferred origin it orders all origins by its author priority and
   selects then the best one among the highest priority author. It also defines the
   author priority for custom priority checks \(eventAssociation.priorities\).


.. confval:: eventAssociation.methods

   Type: *string*

   Defines the ScoreProcessor interface to be used along
   with priority \"SCORE\".


.. confval:: eventAssociation.priorities

   Type: *list:string*

   The general priority list to decide if an origin becomes preferred.
   The priority decreases in the order of the parameters.
   This list is not used unless this parameter is activated.
   
   Empty priority list: scevent replicates the default hard wired behaviour:
   AGENCY, STATUS, PHASES_AUTOMATIC, TIME_AUTOMATIC
   
   Each item in the list corresponds to a check that is performed.
   Each check computes a score of the incoming origin \(s1\) and the
   current preferred origin \(s2\). If the s1 is lower than s2,
   the incoming origin is rejected and does not become preferred.
   All subsequent checks are ignored.
   If s1 is equal to s2, the next check in the list is performed.
   If s1 is larger than s2, the origin becomes preferred and
   all subsequent checks are ignored.
   
   Available tokens:
   
   AGENCY: check based on agency priorities
   
   AUTHOR: check based on author priorities
   
   MODE: evaluation mode priority: 0 \= unset, 1 \= automatic, 2 \= manual, manual over\-rules automatic
   
   STATUS: priority combined from evaluation status and evaluation mode:
   \-100 \= status is rejected, \-1 \= status is reported,
   0 \= status is preliminary or status is unset and mode is automatic,
   1 \= status is confirmed or status is unset and mode is manual,
   2 \= status is reviewed, 3 \= status is final,
   
   METHOD: check based on the method priorities
   
   PHASES: higher phase count \= higher priority
   
   PHASES_AUTOMATIC: only checks phase priorities for incoming automatic origins
   
   RMS: lower rms \= higher priority
   
   RMS_AUTOMATIC: only check RMS on incoming automatic origins
   
   TIME: more recent origins \(creationTime\) have higher priorities
   
   TIME_AUTOMATIC: only check creationTime priority on incoming automatic origins
   
   SCORE: evaluates the score according to a configured ScoreProcessor and
   prefers the origin\/focalmechanism with the highest score


.. confval:: eventAssociation.delayTimeSpan

   Type: *int*

.. _scevent/RegionCheck:


RegionCheck extension
---------------------

evrc plugin for scevent


.. note::
   **rc.\***
   *Test if events lie within or outside a region.*
   *Events within a region are flagged as positive, outside as negative.*
   *The event type is set accordingly.*
   *Add the plugin "evrc" to the  plugins*
   *parameter to make this feature available.*



.. confval:: rc.regions

   Type: *list:string*

   The list of closed BNA polygon names defining regions for
   flagging event as positive or negative.
   A polygon name defines a positive region but names with prefix \!  \(exclamation mark\)
   define negative regions. Evaluation is done in the order of the
   polygons. The last matching criteria applies and the event type
   is set accordingly.
   
   Default: If events are not positive or are negative regions the
   event type is set to \"outside of network interest\".
   Default: \"\!reject\", use \"accecpt\" to overwrite the default.
   
   Examples:
   
   Events are flagged positive within the polygon \"germany\":
   
   germany
   
   All events are flagged positive but events within the polygon \"quarries\" are negative:
   
   accept,\!quarries
   
   Events within the polygon \"germany\" are flagged positive but
   all other events and events within the polygon \"quarries\" are negaitve:
   
   germany,\!quarries
   
   All events are flagged positive but events within the polygon \"germany\"
   are negative and all events within the polygon \"saxony\" are positive:
   
   accept,\!germany,saxony
   Default is ``!reject``.

.. confval:: rc.readEventTypeFromBNA

   Type: *boolean*

   Read the event type, minDepth and maxDepth from the BNA polygon header. The header may contain
   the values, e.g. header of a polygon with name \"quarry\":
   
   \"quarry\",\"rank 1\",\"eventType: quarry blast, minDepth: \-5, maxDepth: 10\",13
   
   When eventType is set, it supersedes eventTypePositive and eventTypeNegative.
   When not set, eventTypePositive and eventTypeNegative are considered.
   Default is ``false``.

.. confval:: rc.eventTypePositive

   Type: *string*

   New type of an event which is flagged positive. Ignored
   if readEventTypeFromBNA is active.
   
   Empty: Do not set type


.. confval:: rc.eventTypeNegative

   Type: *string*

   New type of an event which is flagged negative. Ignored
   if readEventTypeFromBNA is active.
   
   Empty means default: \"outside of network interest\"
   Default is ``"outside of network interest"``.

LOCSAT locator for SeisComP.

Description
===========

The LocSAT locator interface implements a wrapper for the LocSAT locator
written by Walter Nagy (according to the README file shipped with the
LocSAT distribution).


Travel time tables
==================

SeisComP ships with two predefined travel time tables: tab and iasp91.
LocSAT travel time tables are located under :file:`share/locsat/tables/`.

The default profile is *iasp91*.


Station corrections
===================

LocSAT does not support station corrections natively. At least checking
the code:

.. code-block:: c

   sta_cor[i]  = 0.0;    /* FIX !!!!!!*/


However the SeisComP wrapper adds this feature. It allows to define a
:file:`.stacor` file which defines corrections of observation times
in seconds. A correction is **subtracted** (not added) from
the observation time to be compatible with the NonLinLoc station correction
definitions (http://alomax.free.fr/nlloc/soft3.03/control.html#_NLLoc_locdelay_).

Each LocSAT profile (travel time table) can have an associated station
correction file. To use station corrections for the iasp91 tables, the file
:file:`share/locsat/tables/iasp91.stacor` needs to be created.

A station correction table looks like this:

.. code-block:: sh

   # LOCDELAY code phase numReadings delay
   LOCDELAY GE.MORC P 1 -0.1

The fourth column (numReadings) is ignored and just provided for compatibility
reasons with NonLinLoc.

Format
------

- **code** (*string*) station code (after all alias evaluations)
- **phase** (*string*) phase type (any of the available travel time tables)
- **numReadings** (*integer*) number of residuals used to calculate mean residual/delay (not used by NLLoc, included for compatibility with the format of a summary, phase statistics file)
- **delay** (*float*) delay in seconds, subtracted from observed time

Configuration
=============


.. confval:: LOCSAT.profiles

   Type: *list:string*

   Defines a list of available LOCSAT tab directories.
   Default is ``iasp91,tab``.

.. confval:: LOCSAT.enableConfidenceEllipsoid

   Type: *boolean*

   Compute the confidence ellipsoid.
   Default is ``false``.

.. confval:: LOCSAT.depthInit

   Type: *double*

   Unit: *km*

   The initial depth estimate for LocSAT.
   Default is ``20.0``.

.. confval:: LOCSAT.defaultTimeError

   Type: *double*

   Unit: *s*

   The default pick time uncertainty assigned to LocSATs arrival deltim
   attribute if pick uncertainties are not going to be used or
   if they are absent. A time uncertainty of 0 s may result in
   errors of the SVD decomposition in LocSAT.
   Default is ``1.0``.

.. confval:: LOCSAT.usePickUncertainties

   Type: *boolean*

   Whether to use pick time untertainties for arrival deltim rather
   than a fixed time error. If true then the uncertainties are
   retrieved from each individual pick object. If they are not
   defined then the default pick time uncertainty will be used
   as fallback.
   Default is ``false``.

.. confval:: LOCSAT.degreesOfFreedom

   Type: *int*

   Number of degrees of freedom.
   Default is ``9999``.

.. confval:: LOCSAT.confLevel

   Type: *double*

   Confidence level between 0.5 and 1.
   Default is ``0.9``.
